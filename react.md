# ðŸ“˜ Core Frontend (React + Next.js) â€“ 50 Interview Questions & Answers

This document contains **50 advanced React.js & Next.js interview questions with detailed answers**, tailored for Vishalâ€™s profile (6+ years experience, Module Lead at Happiest Minds, strong in React/Next.js, Auth, Razorpay, FHIR APIs).

---

## 1. Explain React Fiber architecture.
**Answer:** React Fiber is a rewrite of Reactâ€™s reconciliation algorithm. It splits rendering into units called **fibers**, allowing React to pause, prioritize, or resume work. This enables **concurrent rendering**, smooth animations, and better handling of large updates.

---

## 2. How does React reconcile changes in the Virtual DOM?
**Answer:** React compares the Virtual DOM tree with the previous one using the **diffing algorithm**. It uses **keys** for list items to track changes and updates only the necessary DOM nodes, improving performance.

---

## 3. Difference between `useEffect`, `useLayoutEffect`, and `useInsertionEffect`.
**Answer:**
- `useEffect`: Runs asynchronously after paint â†’ used for API calls, subscriptions.
- `useLayoutEffect`: Runs synchronously before paint â†’ good for DOM measurements.
- `useInsertionEffect`: Runs before mutations â†’ useful for CSS-in-JS libraries.

---

## 4. What are Suspense and Concurrent features in React?
**Answer:**
- **Suspense:** Allows components to wait for async data before rendering.
- **Concurrent Mode:** Enables React to render in chunks, pause/resume, leading to smoother UI.

---

## 5. How would you optimize re-rendering in a large React app?
**Answer:**
- Use `React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`.

**Answer:**
- ISR (`revalidate`).

---

## 13. Difference between `getServerSideProps`, `getStaticProps`, and `getInitialProps`.
**Answer:**
